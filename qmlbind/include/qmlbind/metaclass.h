 * \defgroup metaclass_module qmlbind_metaclass
 * \brief Defines an object type for use in QML type system.
 *
 * It enables you to wrap client objects into a [QML object type](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-typesystem-objecttypes.html) and instantiate them in QML.
 * It is also possible to create wrappers as `qmlbind_value` in `qmlbind_engine_new_wrapper`.
 *
 * Internally, the `qmlbind_metaclass` creates a [QMetaObject](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmetaobject.html) for the wrapper Qt objects.
 *
 * libqmlbind's rough equivalent of [Meta-Object Compiler](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/moc.html).

 * \param callbacks is used to create, use and delete instances of the metaobject to build.

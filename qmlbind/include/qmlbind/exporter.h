 * \param classRef will be given as parameter to the `new_object` function of the interface. You can use it to hand over
 * the equivalent of class objects in your language to implement a generic `new_object` function. If you don't need it,
 * just hand over a nullpointer. This function does not take ownership of the classRef, but it still needs to be valid
 * for as long as new objects are created (i.e. the whole application lifetime).
 *
 * \param className is used for registering the metaobject created with this exporter in the metaobject system.
 *
 * \param qmlbind_interface is copied, so it does not need to outlive `qmlbind_exporter`s created with it and can
 * be destroyed as soon as all exporters are created.

 * \brief Adds a new property `name` for the resulting metaobject, which should emit `notifierSignal` on changes.
 *
 * Properties in libqmlbind are always readable and writable from QML code, and must have a notifierSignal for changes.
 * Other possibilities, like a read-only or a constant proprerty, are not yet explicitly supported. But of course you
 * could can use a signal that is never emitted and refrain from writing to the propertiesâ€¦
 *
 * Read & write operations will be executed through
 * `qmlbind_interface_handlers`' `read_property` & `write_property` functions.
 *
 * \param notifySignal has to be a valid signal name, which means neither a nullptr nor an empty string. The
 * signal should be added with `qmlbind_exporter_add_signal` in advance, or else a warning will be issued.
 * Notify signals are usually named `<propertyname>Changed` in Qt.
 *
 * libqmlbind's equivalent of [Q_PROPERTY](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/properties.html), always using READ, WRITE and NOTIFY.

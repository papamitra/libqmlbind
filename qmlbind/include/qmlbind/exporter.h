 * implement a generic `new_object` function. If you don't need it, just hand over a nullpointer. This function does not
 * take ownership of the classObject, but it still needs to be valid for as long as new objects are created (i.e. the
 * whole application lifetime).
 *
 * \param className is used for registering the metaobject created with this exporter in the metaobject system.
 *
 * \param interfaceHandlers is used to create, use and delete instances of the metaobject to build.
 * You can either create a single, generic one and pass that to every new \ref qmlbind_exporter_new, or create specific
 * ones for each exporter.

 * could can use a signal that is never emitted and refrain from writing to the propertiesâ€¦
 *
 * Read & write operations will be executed through
 * `qmlbind_interface_handlers`' `read_property` & `write_property` functions.
 *
 * \param notifierSignal has to be a valid signal name, which means neither a nullptr nor an empty string. The
 * signal should be added with `qmlbind_exporter_add_signal` in advance, or else a warning will be issued.
 * Notify signals are usually named `<propertyname>Changed` in Qt.
